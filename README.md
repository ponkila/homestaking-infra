# Homestaking-infra
Ethereum home-staking infrastructure powered by Nix

## About
Transparency is crucial for spreading knowledge among Ethereum infrastructures, benefiting new home-stakers and maintainers to improve their existing setup. With Nix, the entire configuration of the real, working infrastructure can be seen at glance. This is extremely useful for those involved in the maintenance of these machines, as it provides a clear understanding of what's under the hood and makes it easy to see the setup as a whole.

We are currently working on [HomeStakerOS](https://github.com/ponkila/HomestakerOS) and [Nixobolus](https://github.com/ponkila/nixobolus), which are designed to provide users with an easy way to configure, build and deploy this kind of infrastructure via WebUI.

## Keypoints
- Multiple NixOS configurations for running Ethereum nodes
- Supports declarative disk partitioning via [disko](https://github.com/nix-community/disko)
- Runs on RAM disk, providing significant performance benefits by reducing I/O operations
- Deployment secrets using [sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix) for secure handling of sensitive information
- Utilization of [ethereum.nix](https://github.com/nix-community/ethereum.nix) providing an up-to-date package management solution
- [Overlays](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overlays) offer a convenient and efficient way to manually update or modify packages, ideal for addressing issues with upstream sources
- Offers `isoImage` or `kexecTree` output formats depending on the host configuration

## Structure
- `flake.nix`: Entrypoint for host configurations.
- `shell.nix`: Devshell for boostrapping. Accessible via `nix develop`.
- `home-manager`: Home-manager configurations.
- `hosts`: NixOS configurations. Accessible via `nix build`.
- `modules`: Shared module configurations.
- `overlay`: Patches and version overrides for some packages.
- `pkgs`: Our custom packages.
- `system`: Shared system configurations and formats.

## Hosts
| Hostname | System | Format | Info
|-|-|-|-|
dinar-ephemeral-alpha | x86-64 | isoImage | Lighthouse + Erigon
dinar-ephemeral-beta | x86-64 | isoImage | Lighthouse + Erigon
hetzner-ephemeral-alpha | x86-64 | kexecTree | Dedicated build server
hetzner-ephemeral-beta | aarch64 |  kexecTree | Cloud build server
ponkila-ephemeral-beta | x86-64 | kexecTree | Lighthouse + Erigon
ponkila-ephemeral-gamma | aarch64 | kexecTree | Raspberry Pi 4 
ponkila-persistent-epsilon | x86-64 | | Darwin

Note: Some of these hosts are currently being set up and will be added to hosts directory soon.

## Building (no cross-compile)
Tested on Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS aarch64, 5.15.0-69-generic

- With Nix package manager (recommended)
    ```
    nix build .#<hostname>
    ```
    <details>
    <summary>Install Nix</summary>

      # Let root run the nix installer (optional)
      $ mkdir -p $HOME/.config/nix
      $ echo "build-users-group =" > $HOME/.config/nix/nix.conf

      # Install Nix in single-user mode
      $ curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
      $ . $HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh

      # Install nix-command
      $ nix-env -iA nixpkgs.nix

      # Allow experimental features (optional)
      $ echo "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" >> $HOME/.config/nix/nix.conf

      # Accept nix configuration from a flake (optional)
      $ echo "accept-flake-config = true" >> $HOME/.config/nix/nix.conf
    </details>

- Within [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) / [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/tutorials/installation#installing-on-linux)
    ```
    podman build . --tag nix-builder --build-arg hostname=<hostname>
    ```

    ```
    podman run -v "$PWD:$PWD":z -w "$PWD" nix-builder
    ```
    <details>
    <summary>Debug notes</summary>

      This error occurs when `programs.fish.enable` is set to `true`

## Disk formatting

We use declarative disk partitioning by [disko](https://github.com/nix-community/disko). For each host, there is a disko script that contains the desired disk layout. There are a lot of [examples](https://github.com/nix-community/disko/tree/master/example) available on how to configure the layout.

To apply the disk layout to a target machine, you'll need to boot the machine using the built image and obtain the `mounts.nix` file for that specific host. Once you have the file, execute the following command:

```
sudo nix run github:nix-community/disko -- --mode create ./mounts.nix
```

This command will format the disks according to the script. Once formatting is complete, reboot the machine and the disks should be ready to use.
